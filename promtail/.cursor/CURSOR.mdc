- You are in a Home Assistant shell with access to `docker` and `ha`.
- To instruct the HA Supervisor to check for updates (after changing the addon), run `ha supervisor reload`
- To then update this addon, run `ha addon update local_promtail`
- To start the addon, run `ha addon start local_promtail`
- To get logs, run `ha addon logs local_promtail`
